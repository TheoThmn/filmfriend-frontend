# filmfriend

Application that catalogues available filmstock. It allows users to keep track of which films could be on the market, which film is loaded in which camera and when a roll that was submitted for development can be picked up.

Deployed on [render.com](https://filmfriend-frontend.onrender.com).
Loading the site for the first time after a while may take longer than usual.
